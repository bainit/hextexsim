	Hextexsim needs:
	1). Linux system
	2). gcc in version 4.9 supporting openmp
	3). gsl library in version 1.16

INSTALATION
	To build, use:

	./configure
	make
	
	# or:

	./configure --prefix=path/to/destination/folder
	make
	make install

USAGE
	hextexsime <settings_file> <grains_file> <slip_systems_file> <hardening_file> <output_dir>

DESCRIPTION OF INPUT FILES
	Settings file contains a process information. 
	Grains file is .sor file (which is supported by many softwares for texture analysis e.g. LaboTex or MTEX).
	Slip systems file contains information about all slip systems in a particular cell structure.
	Hardening file contains information about hardening parameters according to the model used. So far exponential model is used, but in future some other models may be introduced.
	output_dir is a directory where hextexsim places the results.
	For detailed description of input files please read example-files/DESCRIPTION.

EXAMPLE FILES
	In folder example-files you can find example of input files for fcc metals.

FURTHER PROCESSING
	Into <output_dir> are placed the results of calculations. The texture_result.csv file should be processed by a software for texture analysis e.g. LaboTex or MTEX. The file is in .sor format. In columns angles phi1, PHI, and phi2 in radians are stored. The weight of each orientation is 1.
