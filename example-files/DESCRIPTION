Settings file
	First line is a number of steps in deformation process
	Second line is a deformation step
	In lLines 4-6 is a deformation strain tensor. In the given example there is strain tensor for rolling
	In lines 8-10 is constrain tensor K1
	Lines 12-14 is a constrain tensor K2

Grains_file
	In this file are stored Euler angles in radians for each grain
	First column is phi1, second PHI and third phi2

Slip systems file
	This file contains label, slip plane and slip direction (in orthonormal and orthogonal space), and critical resolved shear stress (crss) of each slip system/twinning mode which takes part in deformation of particular cell structure.
	First column is slip system label
	In columns 3-5, hkl of a given slip plane
	In columns 7-9, uvw of a given slip direction
	In column 11 crss in MPa of a given slip system

Hardening file
	In this file a matrix describing latent hardening factors between every slip system is stored. The order of slip systems shoud be the same like in slip system file. Last line provides hardening parameters according to equation
	crss(i) = crss(i-1)/crss * f1 * exp(f2) * pow(crss,f3)
