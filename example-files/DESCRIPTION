settings_file (settings)
	The first line contains a number of steps in the deformation process.
	The second line contains a deformation step.
	Lines 4-6 contain a deformation strain tensor. In the given example there is a strain tensor for rolling.
	Lines 8-10 contain the constraints tensor K1.
	Lines 12-14 contain the constraints tensor K2.

grains_file (random_texture_very_long_rad.csv)
	In this file, Euler angles are stored in radians for each grain.
	The first column is phi1, the second is PHI and the third is phi2.

slip_systems_file (fcc_metals)
	This file contains the label, slip plane and slip direction (in orthonormal and orthogonal space), and critical resolved shear stress (crss) of each slip system/twinning mode which takes part in the deformation of a particular cell structure.
	The first column contains a slip system label.
	Columns 3-5 contain the hkl of a given slip plane.
	Columns 7-9 contain the uvw of a given slip direction.
	Column 11 contains the crss in MPa of a given slip system.

hardening_file (fcc_hardening)
	In this file a matrix describing the latent hardening factors between every slip system is stored. The order of slip systems should be the same like in the slip system file. The last line provides hardening parameters according to the following equation:
	crss(i) = crss(i-1)/crss * f1 * exp(f2) * pow(crss,f3)
