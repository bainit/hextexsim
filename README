Hextexsim is a piece of software for texture evolution simulations in deformed metals according to the Taylor model.

LICENCE
	The software is distributed under the MIT Licence. You can find the licence in the LICENCE file.

	Hextexsim requirements:
	1). Linux system
	2). gcc in version 4.9 supporting openmp
	3). gsl library in version 1.16

INSTALLATION
	To build, use:

	./configure
	make
	
	or:

	./configure --prefix=path/to/destination/folder
	make
	make install

USAGE
	hextexsime <settings_file> <grains_file> <slip_systems_file> <hardening_file> <output_dir>

DESCRIPTION OF INPUT FILES
	The settings_file contains process information. 
	The grains_file is the .sor file (which is supported by many software programs for texture analysis e.g. LaboTex or MTEX).
	The slip_systems_file contains information about all slip systems in a particular cell structure.
	The hardening_file contains information about the hardening parameters according to the model used. So far the exponential model has been used thus far, but in the future some other models may be introduced.
	output_dir is a directory where hextexsim places the results.
	For a detailed description of the input files, please read example-files/DESCRIPTION.

EXAMPLE FILES
	In the folder example-files, you can find examples of input files for fcc metals.

FURTHER PROCESSING
	The results of the calculation are placed into the <output_dir>. The texture_result.csv file should be processed by a software program for texture analysis e.g. LaboTex or MTEX. The file is in .sor format. Euler angles phi1, PHI, and phi2 in radians are stored in columns. The weight of each orientation is equal to 1.
